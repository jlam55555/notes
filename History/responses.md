### a
Corn fertility was one major environmental factor that influenced Native American culture. A more suitable land for corn cultivation and a higher degree of corn agriculture usually corresponded with an advanced Native American society, usually because a developed method of farming corn usually required complex irrigation and farming techniques. This was evident in the prominent Pueblo and Cahokia tribes.
### b
After the Europeans had left the Native Americans weak and crippled with disease, trading with them for more advanced items seemed very attractive. Thus, a very competitive environment was created, and many Native Americans fought over tradeable items, thus injuring themselves even more.
### c
The Iroquois Confederacy was a coalition of five tribes that worked together even before the Europeans arrived. Between themselves, they established a culture revolving strongly around their military strength, and they instituted multiple common rules that defined their cultures and made them all similar.

### a
Perhaps the largest influencing factor of the Columbian exchange was the introduction of pathogens to the Native Americans. European diseases, such as smallpox and malaria, killed over 90% of the Native American population, who had never seen these diseases and had no immunity. This weakened them and made them vulnerable to European conquest. This was mirrored but to a lesser degree with Native American diseases such as syphilis introduced to the Europeans.
### b
Native Americans quickly adapted to some of the new species that originated from Europe, especially horses. The tribes that learned to use these horses to their advantage and become highly mobile became very powerful, using this to their advantage over unmounted tribes. This was evident in tribes such as  the Comanche, Appache, and Navajo tribes.
### c
There was an abundance of new foods to be found in the Americas for the Europeans, including corn, beans, tomatoes, and potatoes. These new foods helped feed Europe and greatly contributed to its growing population.

### a
In the encomienda system under Spanish rule, Native Americans were "commended" to colonists to be converted to Christianity, ideally. This shows how the spread of their faith and conversion was a major way the Europeans sought to influence Native American culture.
### b
Pop√©'s Revolution was an example of the Native Americans' resistance to the Spanish mistreatment and imposition of Christianity. They destroyed churches to show that they did not want to be converted to Christianity; they did not want the Spanish to force them to change their beliefs.
### c
Many Europeans believed that the Native Americans were simply imbeciles who were inferior to themselves. As a result, the Europeans patronized them and treated them like animals because they believed that they were no more intelligent than them.

### a
The Anglo-Powhatan Wars were an example of a conflict between the Native Americans and the Europeans. The Powhatans were agitated because the Europeans were on their land; the Europeans were desperate because they had no food. The conflict was precipitated by a formal declaration of war against the Native Americans by the English, which was followed by an European victory.
### b
The Pequot War was an uneasy conflict between the colonists and the Native Americans. Again, the invading Europeans pressured the Pequots, who were previously peaceful, to become hostile. Again, this led to an European victory, and the annihilation of the Pequot tribe.
### c
Bacon's Revolution was an uprising of the commoner colonists rising up against authority. The revolters, many of them landless and poor, thought the governor's wealth was undeserved and his profitable fur trade with the Native Americans was unchecked.

### a
One example of continuing contact between the colonists and the Native Americans was at the frontier. The Native Americans keep trying to stay their ground, but they keep getting pushed back by the colonists. This often resulted in skirmishes, sometimes wars, and occassionally the decimation of entire tribes.
### b
Trade was one example of a continuing contact between the Americans and the Native Americans. The Native Americans had fur that the Americans wanted, and the colonists had firearms and other advantageous items. As a result, this trade was very fierce, and Native American life became more violent and competitive to increase their supply of tradeable items and because they had access to weapons such as firearms.
### c
The colonists had some differing opinions about the increasing conflicts with the Native Americans. The overwhelming majority believed that the Native Americans were inferior and ought to be subject to European superiority, and thus kept pushing. But some others saw the intelligence in the Native Americans, sought to avoid comflict, and perhaps even continue peaceful interactions such as trade.

### a
The Spanish colonized base on the ideals of "gold, glory, god," especially the latter. When they conquered, they focused much of their effort towards converting the Native Americans to Christianity. This usually involved the commending of Native Americans to work for Spanish colonists on encomiendas. In addition, the Spanish had much influence over the West Indies, colonizing many of the islands and turning them into sugar factories.
### b
The English colonization had a major portion consisting of regular people, many of them fleeing religious persecution. This led to the many of the new colonies and their governing rules being formed on very religious bases. These regular people were often poor as well, many of them making tough lives as indentured servants working for wealthier colonists.
### c
Development of new land was much more organized in the North (New England) than it was in the South. In the North, "proprietors" were given a plot of land, and they established orderly towns with certain requirements, including schools for more populous developments. In the South, development and exploration was usually done by the lone farmer looking for more land, and this led to a more random and sporadic regional development.

### a
Colonialism of America by the Dutch was considered a threat by the English, thus tensing the two nations' relationship. As a result, the English took over New York and the rest of the Dutch colonies, and it assimilated its culture into American culture. This not only resolved an economic dispute, but it solved the problem of the north and south English colonies being separated.
### b
The growth of the farming economy in the West Indies and, later, in the southern American colonies caused an increase in labor. At first, the indentured servants from England was enough to suffice the needs of the mainland colonies. However, later, slaves were necessary to supply the enormous demand, which strengthened the slave trade with west African nations.
### c
The English Navigation Laws were an example of Anglicanization (imposing English values) via interaction with other Atlantic nations. These laws sought to strengthen English grip on American trade.
## 11
### a
Women in the North (New England) were generally more powerful than women in the South. Aside from living longer on average, they had an established role with midwifery, had a steady and respected role as housewives, and were protected by decency laws from their husbands. In the South, however, because of their shorter life expectancy, women often had rights to property after their husbands died because they usually died very quickly and the wives had little to support their children with.
### b
Improved industries, especially lumbering and shipbuilding, helped push people to the northern colonies such as Massachussets, even despite the infertile soil. This makes sense because of the abundance of sea (for shipbuilding) and forest (for lumber) in the northeast.
### c
Free migration, especially indentured servants, was the major source of immigrants to start, especially in the South. These white servants were cheaper and more desperate than slaves. Later, however, as slaves became more prevalant and cheaper, this forced migration greatly pushed the farming economy in the South, making the market more competitive. As a result, land was quickly taken and new land was rare, so this also encouraged new exploration for land in the South.

### a
The painting suggests that the North American culture strongly reflects that of England. A wealthy colonist shown in the image seems to be dressed and possessing items of high class similar to those in England (e.g., rarities from China, which were likely bought through England).
### b
Some colonies, such as New York and South Carolina, remained largely class-based, similar to how it was in England. There was an aristocratic class on top that ruled with large, sprawling estates, similar to the stratisfied English social system.
### c
Pennsylvania was a notable example of the uniqueness of American culture. Its founder William Penn decided that he wanted to found the colonies on a new and experimental sense of more extreme liberalism, and this deviated far away from the older English values and more towards a modern, freer society. People were more equal and it was further from a feudalistic society.
