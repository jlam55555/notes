### Chapter 1: New World Beginnings (33,000 B.C.E. - 1769 C.E.)
#### The Shaping of North America
- All of American history is insignificant in reference to the grand scheme of time and the universe
- American terrain formed long ago: the Appalachians, the Rockies, the **Canadian Shield** ("a zone undergirdered by ancient rock, probably the first part of what became the North American landmass to have emerged above sea level" (4)), Mississippi Valley, etc.
    - Much was changed by the glaciers: the Canadian shield was pushed down, created lakes (e.g., the Great Lakes and the Great Salt Lake)

**Geography and the Environment** Although this does not directly affect politics or society, this geological arrangement has set the stage for our American life throughout all of our known history. This land mass that we call North America was only a "New World" to the Europeans because it was a large and separate land mass, formed by the separation of the separation of the great supercontinent Pangea. In addition, the geographical features, such as the Rockies and the Appalachians, are immense physical barriers that probably served a major role in various decisions throughout history.

#### Peopling the Americas
- Most Americans came via "ice bridges" from Asia for 25,000 years until the ice bridges melted
- 35,000 years ago, these were the first "immigrants" into North America
- These first Americans migrated south and east away from the ice and into the warmed climates, populating most of North and South America 
- The Native Americans flourished
    - There were an estimated 54,000,000 Native Americans by the time of Columbus' "discovery of the Americas"
        - To many explorers from Europe, the New World was very unexpected and wondrous: they called it a "world" because it was much more than just new land or a new continent; they also had many misconceptions, such as geographical inaccuracies
    - Created more than two thousand separate languages and many diverse religions and cultures
    - Many tribes formed: Incas (Peru), Mayans (Central America), Aztecs (Mexico); formed different **nation-states**
        - They were very advanced societies with great science (accurate astronomy) and a very strong sense of religion (e.g. lots of human sacrifices)

**Migration and Settlement** This section strongly related to the theme of migration of the first people of the Americas. It explains that far before European intervention, there was already a thriving sense of community and society with the Native Americans, a people that had come over with primitive ways because of the Ice Age many thousands of years ago. It shows that the "New World" was really not so new as it seemed to the Europeans, but a complex and established society.

#### The Earliest Americans
- Agriculture (especially corn farming) allowed Native Americans to thrive
    - Corn crop turned from wild grass into staple of life by hunter-gatherers in Mexico
    - The more advanced the corn cultivation, the more advanced the society (e.g., Pueblo and **Cahokia** settlements with advanced corn farming and irrigation very advanced society and housing)
    - **Three-sister farming** with a combination of beans, cornstalks, and squash further advanced the farming and society
- Most people scattered far and nomadic
- Most women doing work at home, men doing physical work outside
- Women were often more powerful than men, having the power and possessions instead of men ("matrilineal societies")
- Native Americans had a large focus on nature, gave it spiritual connections (unlike Europeans)
- Land was mostly untouched because the Native Americans revered it and because their population was relatively small

**Culture and Society** Native American society was based on corn cultivation: in general, the more advanced their agricultural techniques for this crop, the more advanced their society. This is evident by large and advanced societies such as the Pueblo and Cahokia people, both of whom had built large and impressive housing complexes. This was further epitomized by the presence of a corn god in some societies. Native American life differed in other ways from average European life: for example, women were often more powerful than men, which was a concept that European cultures struggled far more with. Also, the North Americans' culture generally involved a spiritual connection with the land, rather than a more materialistic desire that the Europeans had; therefore, the environment was generally very well kept.

#### Indirect Discoverers of the New World
- Scandinavians were probably the first ones to "discover" America circa 1000 B.C., but they never really expanded past a little settlement
- Many Europeans and power-hungry governments were looking for new land: they discovered more of Asia, Africa, and eventually the New World
- Many Europeans liked the "exotic delights" of Asia, but they were expensive; looked for a new path to make the journey cheaper
- **middlemen** are the people who go between the supplier and the buyer, usually adding high tolls for the difficulty of the journey (i.e., long and dangerous path by boat or camel from Asia to Europe)

#### Europeans Enter Africa
- Marco Polo: an "indirect discoverer" of the New World because he described the riches of the East for which the Europeans sought a cheaper route
- Development of the **caravel**, a type of boat that could sail against the winds, and discovery of new routes with helping winds increased exploration
- Africa began to get exploited by the Europeans:
    - Gold taken into Europe
    - Portuguese created trading posts in Africa for gold and slaves, used same practices as previous African slavers
        - Deliberately separated people from certain tribes and took them far from their homeland in order to prevent rebellion: beginning of true African suppression (and racism?)
        - Set up plantations on coastal islands near Africa (e.g., Madeira, Canaries, Sāo Tomé, Principe, etc.); roots of the **plantation** system
- Portuguese also reached India by going around Africa (Vasco da Gama)

#### Columbus Comes upon a New World
- Stage was set for discoveries:
    - Mariner's Compass was developed, helped sea travel
    - Renaissance improved technology in general
    - Europe had slaves and wealth
    - Spain was becoming rich and united
- Columbus set sail with three small ships and an average crew; bumped into the Bahamas
    - Actually was a "successful *failure*"
    - Called the people there "Indians" because he thought they had reached the Indies (the East)
    - People tried to get around this barrier before they realized it was an entirely new continent

**Work, Exchange, and Technology** As a result for the growing greed of Europe for luxuries and power, new efforts were created in order to further explore the world in order to gain wealth. Through various distinct explorers such as Marco Polo and Vasco da Gama, trade and interest expanded, thus performing a virtuous cycle of increasing exchange and therefore wealth. This was accompanied by an improvement in various technologies, such as the caravel, a better boat for sailing, and other improved navigational techniques. As a result, a steady input of gold and slaves from Africa and exotic goods from Asia&mdash;a great system of economic exchange&mdash; was established, thus increasing the productivity and wealth of Europe in general. Eventually the Americas were discovered, which provided yet another land to use for resources.

#### When Worlds Collide
- The **Columbian Exchange** was when Columbus first visited the Americas and different species and people that had been separated for many thousands of years came into contact again&mdash; an unnatural, biological mixing unheard of beforehand
    - The Europeans encountered many new animals, plants, and foods when they arrived, such as rattlesnakes, iguanas, tobacco, corn, beans, tomatoes, and potatoes
    - The introduction of new foods greatly helped feed Europe and the rest of the world
        - 60% of the world's food nowadays originates from the Americas
    - The Europeans also introduced many species as well, such as horses and sugarcane
        - Horses were quickly adopted into Native American lifestyles; more mobile ones, such as the Apache and Blackfeet tribes, became powerful because of them; more mobile ones, such as the Apache and Blackfeet tribes, became powerful because of them
        - Sugarcane thrived, and gave a huge boost of sugar in Europe
    - Brought many diseases over: smallpox, yellow fever, malaria 
        - Killed majority (90%!) of Native Americans because they did not have any immunity built up: largest killer brought by Europeans
        - Native American people introduced syphilis to Europeans

**America in the World** For the first time, the Europeans had an interaction with the Native American people in North America. There was a huge cultural exchange between the people of the different cultures, as well as the diseases and the animals. Much of this exchange, called the "Columbian exchange," was helpful, bringing new diversity of food that fed more people and animals that had different abilities to foreign lands. However, it also brought diseases that killed many millions of people, especially the Native Americans. Therefore, this first time that America was introduced to the wider world of the Europeans, many of the Native Americans died&mdash; not a great first encounter.

#### The Conquest of Mexico and Peru
- Europeans noticed the abundant gold resources in Native American cultures
- Spain claimed a right to much of the newly-discovered New World in the **Treaty of Tordesilles**; the Portuguese received considerably less, with some land on the coast of modern-day Brazil
- In the Caribbean islands, the Spanish held forces that waited to attack the Americas. They also began testing out the **encomienda** system
    - In an encomienda, the government "commended" natives to loyal colonists so that they could be converted to Christianity. In practice, however, it was like slavery.
    - Many Europeans, especially those who had not personally seen the New World, thought that the Native Americans were clearly inferior and that the system was okay. However, to some of those who were in the Americas, it was plainly cruel and unfair.
- Spanish conquest:
    - Hernán Cortés picked up a slave who knew the language, Malinche (later Doña Marina). He found 20,000 revolting Native Americans to help him. After being welcomed at first, being thought to be a god, they were soon forced out on **noche triste** because of their excessive want for gold. He later laid siege and took over the city.
    - Francisco Pizarro took over the Incas in Peru, took their precious metals
    - *Gold, Glory, and God* were the major motives for most of the conquistadors, but not always in that order. For some, God came first. For others, such as those who fought the Moors in Spain, sought glory.
- Great increase of wealth in Europe led to growth of **capitalism**: people had more money to spend, banks thrived, it paid for Asian goods
- **Mestizos** were of both Indian and European descent
    - This mix is celebrated by some but hated by others

**Politics and Power** The entire conquest was a struggle for power for the Europeans. Whether they wanted glory for themselves, gold for their country, or God for the rest of Europe under the Church, the conquistadors plundered and put people into slavery in order to gain power. This is especially obvious in the great victories of Cortés or Pizarro, but it exists also in the aftereffects, such as the growth of capitalism back in Europe or the beginning of the encomienda system. For example, in the encomiendas, the ones who had natives commended to them got to keep their power and reap a reward. In turn, every additional piece of wealth gained by a conquistador made its country a little more wealthy, and they had more political power.

#### Exploration and Imperial Rivalry
- Some other famous **conquistadors**:
    - Vasco Balboa was the first European to discover the Pacific Ocean by going through Panama
    - Ferdinand Magellan went around the tip of South America, and one out of his five ships completed their journey back to Europe, the first one to travel all the way around the globe
    - Juan Ponce de León explored Florida
    - Francisco Coronado discovered the Grand Canyon and bison
    - Hernando de Soto discovered the Mississippi River
- The Spanish flourished, building universities and colonizing
- The English (John Cabot) and French (Giovanni de Varrazano and Jacques Cartier) started to explore
- **Battle of Acoma** was when Spanish won the Pueblo people and abused them
- **Popé's Revolution** was when the Pueblo people destroyed Spanish churches when their religion was oppressed
- The **Black Legend** states that the Spanish only left misery behind in the Americas: death, slavery, poverty, disease

**America in the World** The exploration of the various European powers of the time greatly increased America's importance to the world. It was no longer just a Spanish possession, but now it was in the global focus for the first time&mdash; it became attractive and important to other countries and it would never lose this global attention even now. It was also the first time that French and English powers would penetrate the Americas, where their influences still remain (in Canada and the U.S.A.) and still hold great power nowadays. 

With the native Americans, there was also a great cultural interaction that increased the worldliness of the European countries: there was some mixing of cultures with mestizos. Although, much like the "Black Legend," the majority of European influence on the Americas was in the form of unfair treatment, there was a small degree of the knowledge and acceptance &mdash; with a little bit of assimilation &mdash; that the Spanish encountered.

### Chapter 2: The Planting of English America (1500-1733)
- Hundreds of thousands of slaves were in the Bahamas
- English had major outpost in Jamestown; French in Québec; Spanish in Santa Fé

#### England's Imperial Stirrings
- England didn't need to compete with Spain, being its long-time ally
- The **Protestant Reformation** disrupted England for a while (King Henry VIII, Protestants v. Catholics)
    - The Protestant English smothered the Catholic Irish, and thought of them as lowly native people

#### Elizabeth Energizes England
- Ambitious Queen Elizabeth I
- "Sought to promote the twin goals of Protestantism and plunder by seizing Spanish treasure ships and raiding Spanish settlements," even though the two countries were allies
    - Sir Francis Drake was most prominent, even got knighted by the Queen
- Attempted colonization at Newfoundland, at **Roanake Island** (Sir Walter Raleigh); both failed
- The **Spanish Armada** was a huge Spanish fleet intended to invade England; it failed because of smaller, faster ships and a storm
    - Followed by Holland's independence (formerly Spain's Netherlands)
    - Followed by the Caribbean Islands' independence (formerly under Spanish rule)
    - Followed a few centuries later by the collapse of the Spanish empire in the Americas
    - Weakened Spain and boosted English spirits

**Politics and Power** There was a great change in the English politics. Many of the people became poor and oppressed in Protestant England; this gave some people the incentive to move away; as a result, many of them were the first English immigrants to the Americas. Meanwhile, Spain was losing massive amounts of power, having previously overextended itself in efforts to become a great colonial power. This was epitomized when their great, invincible "Spanish Armada" was overtaken by a small and inferior crew of smaller English ships. As a result, many English resorted even to piracy of Spanish treasure ships, because they soon had the military advantage over the weakening Spanish. As a result of both this religious change and the weakening Spanish, the English had much reason to become riled up in search for discovery.

#### England on the Eve of Empire
- England's population was rapidly increasing
- More wealthy people (e.g., landlords) were making it more difficult for the less wealthy (e.g., small farmers); many of these poorer people were the first immigrants to America
    - Example: when there was a depression in the trade of wool, sheep farmers drifted off, were "footloose"
- **Primogeniture** means that only first sons could inherit land; younger siblings had to find a life for themselves
- **Joint-stock company** allowed men to pool their money and work together towards an adventure, or invest on someone else's

#### England Plants the Jamestown Seedling
- The **Virginia Company**, a joint-stock company of England, was created in search of gold and a shortcut through to the East
- The **charter** (a document specifying the rights of a group of people) of the Virginia Company allowed them to have the same rights as anyone in England; this was the same for following English expeditions; it was meant to encourage them, so that they would always feel like Englishmen even when away
- Early conditions in Jamestown were miserable, and there were high rates of death
- Primitive wants for peace between Native Americans and the new Virginians (i.e., Pocahontas and John Smith's colony); this was stopped by the new governor's attack against the Native Americans
- John Smith was very strict: "He who shall not work shall not eat"

**Work, Exchange, and Technology** The joint-stock company was created, a great advancement in business that allowed for the hefty investment in such a risky venture. As a result of an increasing population of the England and the increasing persecution against many poorer people or those without land, this encouraged many wealthy investors to look towards the potentially rewarding explorations into the New World. This allowed for important early joint-stock companies, such as the Virginia Company, to get charters from the government and officially go explore in the Americas. 

#### Cultural Clashes in the Chesapeake
- "Powhatan's Confederacy" was the main tribe in power near Jamestown
- English were raiding the Powhatans out of desperation; Lord De La Warr began attacking them with orders from England
- **First Anglo-Powhatan War** took place, and ended with peace treaty (Pocahontas + John Rolfe)
- **Second Anglo-Powhatan War** took place when Native Americans started retaliating; the English received orders to essentially fight till the death, to reduce the Native Americans to nothing
    - Ended with the Powhatans' defeat and strict terms: they were banished and separated from the English; soon they were extinct
    - Powhatans lost because of disease, disorganization, disposability

#### The Indians' New World
- The Native Americans were not prepared to see anything like the large-scale invasion of the Europeans
- Horses changed the lifestyle of many Native Americans
- Disease wiped out entire cultures; sometimes it killed the elders that held all the knowledge, and all the knowledge of a civilization was wiped out
- Trading with Europeans was very attractive, and there was more violence when fighting over tradeable items
- Some tribes banded together against the great English powers, but this didn't last long

**Culture and Society** The Native Americans experienced a great culture shock when the English began to colonize the Americas. Like with the Spanish, the English almost immediately began to fight with the Indians, and quickly won over with superior technology. They came to peace with the natives a few times with treaties, but these were quickly broken because of distrust or dishonesty, and the retaliation often led to the wiping out of entire nations of indigenous Native Americans. This was accompanied still by the outbreak of European diseases, which added to the destruction. In addition, the introduction of the European market also upset Native Americans because it gave them incentive to be more competitive and fight over tradeable items, which in turn led to more violence and death. Even the few confederacies of multiple anti-English tribes that formed as a result of the oppression did not last long.

#### Virginia: Child of Tobacco
- John Rolfe (Pocahontas' husband) founded the tobacco industry
- Tobacco had a high demand from Europe
- Tobacco needed a lot of labor; when people had enough money to buy slaves, this began the slave industry
- **House of Burgesses** was first assembly in the Americas, allowed under the Virginia Company charter; was one of the first "miniature parliaments" in America
- King James I didn't like tobacco nor the House of Burgesses, so the Virginia Company charter was revoked and Virginia became an English colony

## Maryland: Catholic Haven
- Second "plantation colony," fourth English colony
- Created by Lord Baltimore for wealth and for Catholics that were fleeing from Protestant England
    - Lord Baltimore wanted a new feudal system to be started at Maryland
- Also grew a lot of tobacco, and began to use many slaves
- **Act of Toleration** was heavily voted on by the Catholics, so that the Protestants wouldn't suppress them as they had back in England
    - Not only protected Catholics, but also any religion such as Jews and atheists 

**Politics and Power** The two early colonies of Virginia and Maryland were essentially founded on just a few ideals: in Virginia, the tobacco industry and preliminary Parliamentary-like representative assemblies; in Maryland, also the tobacco industry, but religious tolerance as well. This shows how colonies or states can have defining characteristics that can separate them from other colonies by law; it shows how much power the founders of each state, such as John Rolfe and Lord Baltimore, had so much political power determining the purpose of their state.

#### The West Indies: Way Station to Mainland America
- English took over as main Caribbean power (e.g., taking Jamaica)
- Sugar (cane) was main cash crop
    - It was a "rich man's crop" &mdash; only people with sufficient money to start could profit from sugar, because it required a lot of labor and refinement
- Huge import of slaves into the West Indies at this time (80% population were black)
- **Barbados slave code** denied all the basic rights to the slaves, treating them very much like property
- Slave system was copied and implemented for tobacco farming on the mainland colonies 

#### Colonizing the Carolinas
- Civil War in England when King Charles I abolished Parliament; ended in his death
    - This slowed colonization efforts; it picked up speed again afterwards, in the "Restoration period"
- Carolina colony founded under the rule of the Lords Proprietors (eight nobles)
    - Developed close economic ties with the slave islands of the Barbados
    - Also created a heavy slave trade there
    - Major crop was rice

**Geography and the Environment** The tropical climate lent itself to large harvests and better farming. The islands of the Barbados gave an isolated environment for cheap African slaves. Together, these two geographical phenomenons made the Caribbean islands very attractive for wealthy men with lots of money to buy slaves, because sugar cane quickly became the most profitable crop. This was copied, to some extent, to the mainland colonies, but only to a lesser extent that the climate supported. Therefore, much of the early economy of the Americas was based on this profitable region in the West Indies and its good agricultural conditions.

#### The Emergence of North Carolina
- There were many **squatters**, people without an official right to land, who were cast out by the gentry population of most of Carolina: formed North Carolina
- Many of them grew tobacco by themselves, without the money for slaves
- Were known to be nonreligious and welcoming to pirates
- Were very resistant to authority
- Officially separated from South Carolina and became a colony
- Like Rhode Island, was "most democratic, the most independent-minded, and the least aristocratic of the original thirteen English states"
- Were not friendly with Indian population
    - **Tuscarora War** killed and sold many Native Americans into slavery, and the **Yamasee Indians** were widely scattered; last of the powerful southern tribes

**American and National Identity** As a result of the societal shift towards aristocracy that modeled the European life that they were fleeing from, many "squatters," or poverty-stricken and opportunistic people took off in search of a better land, very similar to the eager explorers who had traveled to the Americas in the first place. As a result, they founded a different colony, founded on more American ideals than many of the richer, European-ish colonies: one which was more religiously tolerant and more defiant to authority. This is the same attitude that carried the Americans to separate from England and defy orders because they felt oppressed.

#### Late-Coming Georgia: The Buffer Colony
- Last of the thirteen colonies, 126 years after Virginia, the first
- Was meant to serve as a **buffer**, a way to stall off the Spaniards and French from South Carolina
    - Received governmental funding from the start because of its military importance
- Created by philanthropists: meant to protect northern colonies, protect indebted people, keep slavery out: the "Charity Colony"
    - Was a melting pot of religions

#### The Plantation Colonies
- Southern mainland colonies: Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia
- Large states
- Mostly profitable cash crops
- All had slaves
- Multitude of farms and plantations made churches and schools hard to establish
- All had religious toleration, but major religion was English Protestant Church
- All somewhat expansionary, looking for more land for farmers

**Culture and Society** Georgia was a state developed upon interesting and virtuous beliefs, such as religious tolerance, debtor tolerance, and the prohibition of slavery. This shows the radical and creative mind of some Americans, the new ideas of the time&mdash; those three beliefs would carry on even to today. However, the older system of an economic system ruled by slaves and a Protestant-dominated colony, similar to the other plantation states, quickly won over, and Georgia lost its uniqueness. These plantation states reflected the ideology of old America: slavery, plantations, and some expansionary interests.

#### The Iroquois ("Makers of America" section)
- **Iroquois Confederacy**, or the "League of the Iroquois," was a confederation of the Mohawks, the Oneidas, the Onondagas, the Cayugas, and the Senugas
    - Was a great military power before the Europeans (beginning in the late 1500s)
    - Fought for territory with other Native Americans
        - Eliminated many rival tribes
    - Fought with the Europeans for the fur trade
    - Struggled when European diseases spread
    - Mostly independent, with some common rules
    - Allied with both the English and the French at different times during the French and Indian War
    - Most allied with the British during the American Revolutionary War: the defeat scattered them
        - Many were put into reservations after this time
            - Reservation life quickly sunk into a depressing time, until a man named Handsome Lake revived their spirits
- Society was built around the **longhouse**
    - Very long &mdash; fits its name
    - Fits an entire family, with two to three fireplaces
    - Matriarchal society: matriarch was oldest woman, all the women of the same family stayed in a longhouse
    - Men moved out to wife's longhouse when married

### Settling the Northern Colonies (1619-1700)
- Religion is the major factor deciding the culture of early settlements

#### The Protestant Reformation Produces Puritanism
- Martin Luther => Protestant Reformation
    - Protestant Reformation gave a lot of spirit to many Europeans 
- John Calvin heavily influenced by Luther, **Calvanism** founded based on his beliefs, the doctrine of many Puritans and other religions
    - Wrote *Institutes of the Christian Religion*; said that God was all powerful, **predestination** (destiny) could not always be overcome
    - **Conversion** was the "receipt of God's free gift of saving grace"
    - Expected to demonstrate their willingness to God
    - **Puritans** were people looking to make a complete change to the Roman Catholic Church to "purify" it; most were poor farmers
        - **Separatists** were a "tiny group of dedicated Puritans" that wanted to break away from the Church of England
    - They were more radicals than the Protestants: thought the Protestant Reformation was too slow

#### The Pilgrims End Their Pilgrimage at Plymouth
- One group of Separatists left to Holland to escape persecution, but were unhappy there; made a deal with the Virginia Company and left to Jamestown on the *Mayflower*
    - Missed Jamestown and ended up in in Massachusetts, stopping at Plymouth Bay (after some surveys)
    - **Mayflower Compact** was signed to create a simple government between them; served as an important precedent for later
    - Believed strongly in God, even in the tough times in the New World
    - Eventually merged with the Massachusetts colony

**Culture and Society** Martin Luther and his Protestant Revolution sparked a slew of religious movements that dramatically changed the European culture and that of the explorers of America. When the Roman Catholic Church was deemed flawed by Luther, Puritans formed in response, who were willing to change the Church for the better, and then Separatists formed as an extreme group of Puritans. The beliefs behind the Separatists (and in the Puritans and Luther, to a less extreme extent) gave them the courage to come to America to flee persecution and the perseverance to endure the difficult times as pilgrims. Specifically, this affected the life of many New Englanders of the future who lived in or near the Massachusetts area where the pilgrims settled.

#### The Bay Colony Bible Commonwealth
- More moderate Puritans than the Separatists wanted to reform the Church; however, when reform seemed impossible with anti-Puritan leaders, they sought to leave
    - Created a charter for the **Massachusetts Bay Company**
    - Very well equipped to Massachusetts
    - The **Great English Migration** brought many English over to the Americas during a time of turmoil in England
    - Massachusetts quickly became the most prosperous state with educated leaders and abundance of resources
- The Massachusetts people believed that they could set a model of a holy society for the future

**American and National Identity** At a time when its mother country England was weak, the colonies in America were busy at work, trying to establish themselves and keep to their ideals that were still contrary to English beliefs. This included creating opportunity in the Massachusetts Bay colony and an increase in Puritans wanting to reform the church. As a result, the hard work quickly paid off, making Massachusetts the most wealthy state, and one hopeful with the prospect of making an impact on a world (i.e., by changing the religion in England). This is a great representation of the spirit of independence and opportunity that the Americans have&mdash; they used their largely hands-off freedom to give themselves more control and power.

#### Building the Bay Colony
- All "freemen" (men who were Puritan, under the Congregational Church), could participate in their government (40% of the population)
- Voting with majority usually happened in important town meetings
- Not a democracy; they were afraid of the common people ruling
- The whole point of the government was to support the religion, and nonbelievers paid taxes towards the Church
- Not all power was given to clergymen though; they were not allowed political office, and they had to be elected, in order to avoid another situation like that in England
- Had a "Protestant ethic," a serious work ethic because of God's calling to do work on Earth

#### Trouble in the Bible Commonwealth
- **Antinomianism** is the belief that because of predestination, there was no need to obey law
    - Anne Hutchinson was a strong supporter of this
    - It was high heresy, and she was quickly banished and killed by Native Americans
- Roger Williams was popular, spread ideas of complete separation from the Church of England (Separatism), also banished

**Politics and Power** Religion played an enormous factor in shaping the colonies by changing the political system. This was especially in terms of power allocation, because the people wanted to move away from the corrupted systems like in England. The Puritan majority allowed Puritan men to vote, anyone else to pay taxes to the Congregational church, a secular government (for historical reasons), a strong God-initiated work ethic, and controversial court cases regarding interpretation of religion. Overall, religion began to set up the way the modern system of government works, leaving a legacy with the "Protestant work ethic" and the idea of a town meeting. These men were trying to figure out a way to escape the system of broken religion and government such as that in England, and therefore they endeavored to create a working system of government that both promoted their better form of religion and gave the people more rights; many of those same ideals are preserved into the modern day, although some of their policies may have been changed.

#### The Rhode Island "Sewer"
- Roger Williams fled to Rhode Island, where he set up a Baptist church, with complete freedom of religion (even Jews and Catholics)
    - No oaths nor taxes
    - Made Rhode Island more liberal and advanced than many other communities of the world
    - Lots of freedom of opportunity
    - Full of unwanted people, a "religious sewer"
- Rhode Island officially became a state when it gained a charter

**American and National Identity** The United States are perhaps best known for their "melting pot" diversity and its liberal democracy. By allowing religious tolerance and not imposing any sort of religious tie such as taxes, even reaching beyond Christianity, Roger Williams of Rhode Island pushed his colony to the forefront of social liberalism, welcoming everybody regardless of religious affiliation, a crucial right we enjoy protected in our Constitution as part of the First Amendment. It opened up another freedom to the people, and therefore much opportunity. Therefore, Rhode Island was one of the pioneers of the open diversity that makes America so advanced and unique. 

#### New England Spreads Out
- Connecticut River attracted many people, Hartford was founded
- Connecticut settlers created the **Fundamental Orders**, the first modern constitution
- New Haven merged with Connecticut charter
- New Hampshire was also created

#### Puritans Versus Indians
- Native Americans weak in New England
    - Epidemic after Mayflower landing wiped out 75% of Native American population
- Wampanoag Indians tried to befriend the Europeans at first, held the first Thanksgiving with them
- **Pequot War** was between the Europeans and the Pequots, annihilated the Pequots and created more unrest
- "King Philip" was a Native American that created an alliance of tribes and began to attack settlements; he was defeated, but caused some damage to settlements in **King Philip's War**

**Geography and the Environment** Although the European colonial powers liked to perceive themselves as invincible empires, they were still human beings and had to survive with basic needs and suffer from material enemies. Thus the Connecticut colonies of Hartford and New Haven were bound to the Connecticut River. On the other hand, Native Americans were also inhabiting the same land and hostilities were still high, so a few bitter battles were fought to take the land and to protect themselves from the Native Americans, who were already weakened by disease. However, with inferior technology, the Native Americans posed little threat to the imperialistic pilgrims.

**Migration and Settlement** The creation of Connecticut and New Hampshire are other forms of settlement. They were created like any other colony, as people were attracted to the more hospitable living conditions of the Connecticut River. Their settlement affected the area permanently, also like other colonies, by virtually wiping out the Native Americans. These were some ordinary colonies, but they continued the devastating path of the English.

#### Seeds of Colonial Unity
- **New England Confederation** was when four colonies banded together for defense
    - Two Massachusetts colonies (Bay and Plymouth) and two Connecticut colonies (New Haven and Hartford)
    - Mostly Puritan, excluded the Maine and Rhode Island heretical colonies
 colony
    - Each colony got two votes (equal representation)
    - First step to uniting the colonies
- The **English Civil War** was raging back at home, making the colonies more separated and independent
    - Part of the reason why England was so "hands-off" and let the colonies thrive
- With King Charles II, England was back in control: sought to punish the Puritans and crush any rebellion (i.e., in Massachusetts)
    - Strengthened Connecticut and Rhode Island, and weakened Massachusetts by revoking its charter

**America in the World** Although it was distracted by its civil wars, England quickly fastened its iron grip on the Americas once it had discovered the power and wealth that the colonies were gaining. The New England Confederation was a collaboration that gave the people more power and representation&mdash; the beginnings of a democracy. The citizens of Massachusetts began to gain their rebellious edge, the same that continued through the American Revolution that made it such a huge player in the war and such a patriotic, freedom-fighter spirit. As a result, Massachusetts received punishment similar to the ones it would get in the future in the Revolutionary War. This was, presumably, the first time that England had recognized the growing insurgent threat of the colonies and their first attempt to curb it.

#### Andros Promotes the First American Revolution
- England created the **Dominion of New England** to gain more control over the colonies
    - Had Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and the rest of New England
    - Promoted defense against the Native Americans
    - Was meant to improve efficiency with the **Navigation Laws**
        - These meant to give the English government more control over its trade, especially in a time of fierce maritime competition
- Sir Edmund Andros was the dictator of the Dominion
    - Disliked because he was affiliated with the Church of England and had nasty soldiers
    - Stopped town meetings, created restrictions on the court, the press, and schools, took back land, taxed people without consent, enforced the Navigational laws and stop smuggling
- England had the **Glorious / Bloodless Revolution** that dethroned King James II, gave the inspiration for colonists to revolt
    - Andros sent off in Massachusetts; Massachusetts was given a new, royal charter; changed religious and political ideals (i.e., not anymore Puritan and voting for the majority)
    - New York and Maryland also revolted
    - New royal governors started **salutary neglect**, when the Navigation Laws were not strongly enforced to the Americans' benefit
- More English officials ruled in the Americas, many of whom were less caring because this was just a job and not their native land

**American and National Identity** As the header states, the rebellion sparked by the harsh rule of Edmund Andros on behalf of England could be considered the "First American Revolution." It foreshadows the violence, as well as the passionate American victory and humiliating British defeat that would follow, and thus marks and important part of American history. Like the American Revolution, it shows the people that it is right to fight for the ideals of freedom from suppression and the right to overthrow a government that is unfit to rule&mdash; a founding principle of this nation.

#### Old Netherlanders at New Netherland
- The Dutch got their independence from Spain (the Netherlands/Holland became a country) in the late 1500s with help from England
- The Dutch quickly became very powerful, especially with their navy
    - Fought three naval wars against England
    - Became a colonial power, especially in the East Indies with the Dutch East India Company (and a little with the Dutch West India Company in the Caribbean)
- Henry Hudson was hired to go explore; sailed northwest and discovered a new bay and claimed land for the Dutch; didn't find the shortcut to the East
- Dutch West India Company bought New York and settled in New Netherland around the Hudson River
    - New Amsterdam (now New York City) was run by a Dutch company, simply for commercial purposes
        - **Patroonships** were feudal systems given to people, each of which had at least fifty people settled on them
        - Ethnic diversity started to appear quickly

#### Friction with English and Swedish Neighbors
- Company was under a lot of pressure:
    - Incompetent leaders
    - Shareholders demanding money
    - Threat of Native Americans (wall &rarr; Wall Street)
- Swedish (at the height of their power) trespassed on Dutch lands, and Dutch trespassers were kicked out of the New England colonies
    - The Dutch attacked New Sweden and won; New Sweden faded away, its colonists assimilated into New Netherlands

#### Dutch Residues in New York
- Dutch settlements were not a primary concern, and therefore weak
- New Amsterdam was taken over by the Duke of York (later renamed New York in his honor) over Peter Stuyvesant, and therefore the English owned a continuous stretch of land
    - A strategic win for England: gave them a port and a river into the interior of the land
- Maintained an aristocratic place, poor immigrants not welcome
- Many Dutch influences on culture and names: Stuyvesant (High School), "Harlem, Brooklyn, Hell Gate ... Easter eggs, Santa Claus, waffles, sauerkraut, bowling, sleighing, skating, and golf"

**America in the World** Rather than the American colonies imposing their own culture on other countries, other colonial powers lent their own culture to the colonies as residual settlements. Although they were not primary political nor economic concerns of the Swedish and the Dutch, the cities that they had left behind held enormous import to our culture and even our language, as well as great cities such as New York City. Some of this was ethnic diversity; some was an aristocratic society; some were holiday customs. Together, however, they form a diverse group of interesting societal quirks that the Americans gained by conquering the territories of other nations. Interestingly, this competition for power between the nations gave a benevolent assimilation of cultures rather than an obliteration as had been with the Native Americans, most likely because of the Americans' higher respect for the former.

#### Penn's Holy Experiment in Pennsylvania
- **Quakers** were "dissenters" that supposedly quaked when empowered by "religious emotion"; officially the Religious Society of Friends
    - Refused to pay taxes to the Church of England and had very distinctive ways, many of which put them in conflict with authority
    - Were "a simple, devoted, democratic people, contending in their own high-minded way for religious and civic freedom" &mdash; won with passive resistance
    - Many were punished or killed for their resistance
- William Penn was a devout Quaker from a young age
    - Looked to the new world for a haven for Quakers, experimentation with a more liberal government, and personal profit
    - Gained land granted from the King (Pennsylvania) in return for a debt from the government
- Pennsylvania was well and honestly advertised to a diverse group, attracted many immigrants

#### Quaker Pennsylvania and Its Neighbors
- A wonderful haven to all: (many of these liberal policies are still in place)
    - Well-planned city was attractive
    - Invited many squatters in from other colonies
    - Had great relations with the Native Americans (until non-Quakers disrupted this relationship)
    - Very liberal society, had an elected representative assembly
    - Taxes didn't go towards church
    - Freedom of worship (religion)
    - Less common death penalty
    - No military
    - No restrictions on immigration and easy process of naturalization
    - Against slavery
    - **Blue Laws** to keep the peace
- Modern society boosted "economic opportunity, civil liberty, and religious freedom"
    - Quickly became the third-most prosperous state (after MA and VA)
    - Followed by the acquiring of New Jersey with similar principles
    - Delaware was also closely tied with Pennsylvania and its ideals

**Culture and Society** Similar to what had happened in New England a little earlier with religiously-tolerant Rhode Island, Pennsylvania was a bustling colony of ideas very different from those of the time and very similar to what we value nowadays. They moved away from the strict and restricting laws of the Old World that they were escaping from and moved towards a secular, more opportunity-prone and free society. Some of those ideas are even considered liberal and controversial today, such as no restrictions on immigration and no death penalty. In addition, their system of representative government was also a more modern system; like the earlier town meetings, they worked to get more equal society by having the people vote on elected assemblies. In that world where many people still had a more conservative mindset, Pennsylvania also portrayed the persevering mindset that allowed it to convert some other colonies to hold similar beliefs, similar to how the United States is still trying to convert other nations to democracy as a better government.

#### The Middle Way in the Middle Colonies
- Middle colonies: NY, NJ, DE, PA
- Fertile soil and flat lands &rarr; grew much grain
- Large rivers &rarr; fur trade
- Forests &rarr; lumber and shipbuilding industries
- In between New England and the South in terms of land size and amount of industries (more land in the South and fewer industries, and vice versa for the North)
- More ethnically diverse and socially liberal, with more democracy (more "American")
    - Benjamin Franklin, a "true American," thrived in Philadelphia, PA

**Geography and the Environment** The colonies used the land for what they could: in the southern states, farming was the largest source of income. There was more industry up north with the older colonies and a larger percentage of more educated people. The size of land and the amount of industry varied from North to South with what was appropriate; this large variety and the adaptations the people made to best use the land gave the Americans the most fruitful results for their efforts. As a result, the "middle colonies" &mdash; those in between the North and the South both geologically and in terms of industry and farming&mdash; had the most mixing of the different kind of people, and thus was the most "American" because of its diversity of people and ideas.

### Chapter 4: American Life in the Seventeenth Century
#### The Unhealthy Chesapeake
- People were very short-lived in the Chesapeake (around Virginia)
    - Average life expectancy (median) around 20
    - Population growth from immigration alone
    - Most marriages lasted under seven years because of a death
- Women lived shorter and were greatly outnumbered by men; made them very desirable
- This turned around in the early 1700s, when Virginia became the most populous state

#### The Tobacco Economy
- Tobacco was easily grown in the Chesapeake area, but it overexerted the land
    - Farmers had to keep looking for new land, often going into Native American lands and provoking attacks
    - Increased demand &rarr; increased supply through more farming and land
- Desperate, unemployed Europeans main source of labor
    - **Indentured servants** were these desperate whites, making a contract for several years under a master in exchange for a free trip to America and freedom dues
        - Freedom dues included an ax, a hoe, barrels of corn, suit of clothes, and land (increasing rarely land because of scarcity)
- **Headright system** in place in Virginia and Maryland that encouraged indentured servants: if a master paid for the voyage to America for a servant, they got fifty acres of land
    - System could be played to gain lots of land (and therefore lots of power as the demand for land increased)
- Life was hard for indentured servants: rarely got land, got punished with longer contracts, often were poor enough to seek reemployment after freedom

**Geography and the Environment** The fertile land of the South was the only reason people could still live and survive. With such short life spans and little advancement in professional occupations, land provided a steady source of income and work. This greatly changed the way of life by encouraging Englishmen to immigrate to gain an opportunity through farming to freedom. Geography also shaped society by putting a strain on farmers for land: the geographical needs of the people were growing ever more, and systems such as the Headright system were only put in place to match this economical-geopolitical need. And, because of these two geographical features &mdash; agriculture-dependent South and the rarity of free land &mdash; the South became somewhat of a feudal system, with land-owning farmers being the most powerful. 

#### Frustrated Freemen and Bacon's Rebellion
- There were increasing numbers of unemployed, poor, desperate people in the late 1600s
    - Frustrated because they couldn't find land and a mate
- A revolt led by Nathaniel Bacon against Governor Berkeley of Virginia broke out (**Bacon's Rebellion**)
    - Didn't like the friendliness between governor and Indians (government monopolized the fur trade)
    - Attacked Native Americans and chased out Berkeley
    - Bacon and many of his men soon died, allowing the governor again to take power and punish some of the offenders
    - Made the angry unemployed white people a less attractive source of labor

**Politics and Power** This was another of the early revolts that played an important part in shaping American culture. The people fought against the wealthy in a showdown between the poor commoners and the wealthy men in control. The men who revolted were poor and without a job, and had the 1600s equivalent of a violent worker strike. Perhaps this was another foreshadowing of the American revolution a century in the future, because the governor (like King George) was exploiting the fur trade (like England forcing taxes on the colonies) and giving little benefit to the colonists (no representation for the colonies). However, in this particular event, the colonists were without a win, and succumbed to disease.

**American and National Identity** This was another important stage in the development of many American beliefs. One of them was the ongoing suppression of the Native Americans by the commoners with superior weapons; again, this resulted in vast casualties for the Native Americans. This also established a clear rebellion against suppression by the people, and the willingness to fight for their rights, a fundamental right that was not even written at the time. It also showed that many Americans are just average citizens, looking for work and wanting to earn a good living, but even hardworking citizens do not always have what they want: such is the beginning of the American stories of toil and rise from rags to riches. Unfortunately, this is still in a very early stage and the people are not yet victorious in their efforts.

#### Colonial Slavery
- Over 7 million African slaves were brought over in the 300 years since Columbus (until ~1800)
    - Most ended up in the West Indies or with Spain or Portugal, 400,000 ended up in the American colonies
    - Slaves were more costly than white people
- Slaves began to outnumber indentured servants in the late 1600s
    - Higher wages in England meant fewer people looking to become indentured servants
    - There was an increased demand for labor
    - Planters were afraid of rebellion after Bacon's Rebellion
    - The **Royal African Company** slave-trading monopoly lost power and Americans rushed in to try to make money with the slave trade
- Slaves soon made up as much as half the population in some southern states
- Slaves traveled primarily through the **middle passage** route
    - Mortality rates were upwards of 20%
    - Ports became busy slave markets
- Life for slaves was made harder
    - A few Africans got citizenship after a while, but this decreased when the whites considered them a threat
    - The **slave codes** in Virginia were official rules that declared slaves and posterity the *property* (objective "chattels") of white masters
        - Sometimes teaching literacy was illegal

**Work, Exchange, and Technology** Suddenly, as economic systems change and there is a greater demand for labor, slaves suddenly become more attractive than white indentured servants. Higher wages for Europeans and the collapse of a slave-trading monopoly opened up the opportunity for entrepreneurs to discover the potential profit in slave trading. This eventually led to the importation of hundreds of thousands of African slaves in order to satisfy the needs of the planters. Next, in order to maximize profits, and presumably to shield themselves from the cruelties they imposed on the slaves, the whites established the "slave codes" that made slaves the property of the white planters. As a result, slaves were lowered into the position that they were for many years, with no rights and not even considered a person.

#### Southern Society
- Socioeconomic gap began to spread; a hierarchical system was created
    - Plantation owners at top with many slaves and much land, also powerful in the House of Burgesses
        - They did not abuse their power, and were often hardworking and business-oriented
    - Small farmers made up the majority population
    - Landless whites lived harder lives; fewer as time went on and slaves were more prevalent
    - Slaves were lowest in hierarchy
- Waterways and plantation dominated the South, with cities and roads (more modern infrastructure) made a professional and urban life slower to develop
 
#### The New England Family
- New Englanders had it better with longer lives with a life expectancy around 70 (longer than England's and close to today's)
    - Had clean water and cool temperatures to help them against disease
    - High rates of fertility and early marriage allowed population to boom
        - Many children established housewife-life of many women
    - Grandparents were "invented," now being more common than ever
    - Families were more stable
- Usually women gave up property so as to prevent undermining the rectitude of marriage, unlike in the south when men usually died early and left behind little
- Women could not vote, but their rights were getting stronger
    - Men were punished for uncivil behavior regarding their wives
- Women dominated midwifery (assisting childbirths)
- Marriages usually persisted, only breaking with abandonment or adultery
    - Adultery penalized with public whipping and an "A" badge to wear always

**Culture and Society** There is a very clear distinction between New England and Southern American life. The north had longer life, longer marriages, and therefore stronger familial bonds and more concurrent generations being alive. Women gained more rights than in the South, further promoting their power with longevity. However, in the South, with more physical, disease-prone, and shorter lives, they lived harsher and crueler lives dependent on their land-owning capabilities. Only a few families were in the wealthy upper class, and even they had to try hard to keep their wealth, keep their business going, and keep control of their servants. Overall, society was beginning to settle down, with social classes dominating the south and stronger bonds in towns and families in the North.

#### Life in the New England Towns
- Society based on small villages and farms
- Puritanism played large role in unifying (like Catholic church under the Roman Empire)
- Growth was more deliberate and planned (unlike that of the individuals in the Chesapeake region who wanted more land)
    - "Proprietors" waited for official colonial grants to land; they moved to the designated place and received land and some materials necessary for beginning a town
        - New towns usually had a meeting house, a village green, a woodlot for fuel, growable land for crops, pasture land for animals, and houses
        - Towns with more than fifty families needed elementary education (allowed quick formation of education such as Harvard College)
- **Congregational Church**es were individually run by Puritans with a democracy
    - Promoted idea of political democracy, with meetings in the meeting house to discuss issues and elect officials

#### The Half-Way Covenant and the Salem Witch Trials
- The Church became less powerful and popular
    - **Jeremiad** was a new type of sermon in churches, when preachers scolded others for being less faithful; conversions were less common as well
    - The **Half-Way Covenant** was an agreement that allowed children of baptized but not converted members to be baptized but not have full communion &mdash; a partial membership
        - Convenant = agreement between church and its members
        - Made the Church less exclusive; eventually some let anyone in, coverted or not
- Witch hunts became common
    - In Salem, people accused women of having bewitched them, causing a witch hunt that hanged 20 women and two dogs (the **Salem witch trials**)
    - Might have been a result of higher conflict with Native Americans and social gap: often poorer women accused the wealthy women
    - Ended when the governor stopped it, secured by official law that forgave the women

**Politics and Power** New England became joined through the Puritan Church much like the Catholic Church commanded the Roman Empire. As a result, political structures arose similar to those established in the Church: in the Americas, this meant town-meetings and a democratic-like society. People within a town got equal power to elect their officials and vote on decisions, which was the local model of the democratic system that we have today. In addition to this democratic system, the Church also allowed a more structured expansion. However, the Church also gave people enormous political power, such as during the Salem Witch Trials: what should have gone through a normal court trial case (the executions of accused women and dogs) was instead allowed without rationale by the Church for some time. However, this religious zeal soon faded, even despite the Jeremiah sermons, but the political structures that were established by it stayed in place.

#### The New England Way of Life
- Land was hard to grow from with lots of rocks, but they worked hard to tame the land
- People were also very frugal and tried to get money however they could (notably, whittling "wooden nutmegs" for real ones to get money from)
- Undesirable land and religion made New England less ethnically diverse than the South
- Hard climate (extreme seasons) made economy more diversified than the South (which depended on agriculture)
    - Timber from forests made shipbuilding an industry
    - Lots of cod off the shores for fishing
- The New Englanders thought the Native Americans had wasted the land by not exploiting it enough, and they used it to their advantage, usually damaging the land
    - Livestock ate much grass and increased erosion
- New Englanders often stayed near ports
- Hard life "made for energy, purposefulness, sternness, stubbornness, self-reliance, and resourcefulness"
- Many former New Englanders carried the philosophy with them throughout the rest of America

**Migration and Settlement** People in the Northeast did not have an easy time with the land; as a result, they moved to the places where they could find opportunity to make a living. There were a few people who toiled to tame the rocky land, but this was difficult work. Instead, many people ended up settling on the busy ports along the coast: this offered jobs such as trading, shipbuilding, and fishing. Others moved inland to farm livestock or cut lumber. As a result of these more difficult, professional jobs, and the greater settlement in the cities, New England became a place of busy cities and business professionals &mdash; it remains that way to this day. Most of the early jobs that the people found opportunity to do also still exist. The New Englanders that began to settle farther west also carried these philosophies and occupations of New England life with them.

#### The Early Settlers' Days and Ways
- People were still governed by nature
    - Majority were farmers, governed by seasons
- Women stayed at home, men did the heavy-lifting (very strong gender roles)
- Humble but comfortable lives
- Relatively cheap land in the North
- Most people in America were the middle-class from Europe (wealthy don't move, poor can't move)
- Social classes weren't very pronounced
    - Bacon's Rebellion was against the wealthy in Virginia
    - **Leisler's Rebellion** was against the wealthy in New York
- Equality and democracy began to take root

**American and National Identity** In general, in this late-1600s period of American history, people were living poor, humble lives, struggling to survive &mdash; the beginning of a typical American success story. The average person worked to live comfortable, humble lives, and the feudal caste system in that was more common in Europe was less common as equality and democracy became more prevalent. In addition, two major rebellions, Bacon's Rebellion and Leisler's Rebellion, took place that showed the Americans' indignant, anti-oppression, fighting spirit. As for many years in the future, there were strong gender roles &mdash; women at home and men out in the fields &mdash; and farming was the most common industry in the south, with suppressed slaves forming the backbone of the American identity.
