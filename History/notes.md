# AP US History (APUSH) Summer Reading
##The American Pageant Chapters 1-4

### Chapter 1: New World Beginnings (33,000 B.C.E. - 1769 C.E.)
#### The Shaping of North America
- All of American history is insignificant in reference to the grand scheme of time and the universe
- American terrain formed long ago: the Appalachians, the Rockies, the **Canadian Shield** ("a zone undergirdered by ancient rock, probably the first part of what became the North American landmass to have emerged above sea level" (4)), Mississippi Valley, etc.
    - Much was changed by the glaciers: the Canadian shield was pushed down, created lakes (e.g., the Great Lakes and the Great Salt Lake)

**Geography and the Environment** Although this does not directly affect politics or society, this geological arrangement has set the stage for our American life throughout all of our known history. This land mass that we call North America was only a "New World" to the Europeans because it was a large and separate land mass, formed by the separation of the separation of the great supercontinent Pangea. In addition, the geographical features, such as the Rockies and the Appalachians, are immense physical barriers that probably served a major role in various decisions throughout history.

#### Peopling the Americas
- Most Americans came via "ice bridges" from Asia for 25,000 years until the ice bridges melted
- 35,000 years ago, these were the first "immigrants" into North America
- These first Americans migrated south and east away from the ice and into the warmed climates, populating most of North and South America 
- The Native Americans flourished
    - There were an estimated 54,000,000 Native Americans by the time of Columbus' "discovery of the Americas"
        - To many explorers from Europe, the New World was very unexpected and wondrous: they called it a "world" because it was much more than just new land or a new continent; they also had many misconceptions, such as geographical inaccuracies
    - Created more than two thousand separate languages and many diverse religions and cultures
    - Many tribes formed: Incas (Peru), Mayans (Central America), Aztecs (Mexico); formed different **nation-states**
        - They were very advanced societies with great science (accurate astronomy) and a very strong sense of religion (e.g. lots of human sacrifices)

**Migration and Settlement** This section strongly related to the theme of migration of the first people of the Americas. It explains that far before European intervention, there was already a thriving sense of community and society with the Native Americans, a people that had come over with primitive ways because of the Ice Age many thousands of years ago. It shows that the "New World" was really not so new as it seemed to the Europeans, but a complex and established society.

#### The Earliest Americans
- Agriculture (especially corn farming) allowed Native Americans to thrive
    - Corn crop turned from wild grass into staple of life by hunter-gatherers in Mexico
    - The more advanced the corn cultivation, the more advanced the society (e.g., Pueblo and **Cahokia** settlements with advanced corn farming and irrigation very advanced society and housing)
    - **Three-sister farming** with a combination of beans, cornstalks, and squash further advanced the farming and society
- Most people scattered far and nomadic
- Most women doing work at home, men doing physical work outside
- Women were often more powerful than men, having the power and possessions instead of men ("matrilineal societies")
- Native Americans had a large focus on nature, gave it spiritual connections (unlike Europeans)
- Land was mostly untouched because the Native Americans revered it and because their population was relatively small

**Culture and Society** Native American society was based on corn cultivation: in general, the more advanced their agricultural techniques for this crop, the more advanced their society. This is evident by large and advanced societies such as the Pueblo and Cahokia people, both of whom had built large and impressive housing complexes. This was further epitomized by the presence of a corn god in some societies. Native American life differed in other ways from average European life: for example, women were often more powerful than men, which was a concept that European cultures struggled far more with. Also, the North Americans' culture generally involved a spiritual connection with the land, rather than a more materialistic desire that the Europeans had; therefore, the environment was generally very well kept.

#### Indirect Discoverers of the New World
- Scandinavians were probably the first ones to "discover" America circa 1000 B.C., but they never really expanded past a little settlement
- Many Europeans and power-hungry governments were looking for new land: they discovered more of Asia, Africa, and eventually the New World
- Many Europeans liked the "exotic delights" of Asia, but they were expensive; looked for a new path to make the journey cheaper
- **middlemen** are the people who go between the supplier and the buyer, usually adding high tolls for the difficulty of the journey (i.e., long and dangerous path by boat or camel from Asia to Europe)

#### Europeans Enter Africa
- Marco Polo: an "indirect discoverer" of the New World because he described the riches of the East for which the Europeans sought a cheaper route
- Development of the **caravel**, a type of boat that could sail against the winds, and discovery of new routes with helping winds increased exploration
- Africa began to get exploited by the Europeans:
    - Gold taken into Europe
    - Portuguese created trading posts in Africa for gold and slaves, used same practices as previous African slavers
        - Deliberately separated people from certain tribes and took them far from their homeland in order to prevent rebellion: beginning of true African suppression (and racism?)
        - Set up plantations on coastal islands near Africa (e.g., Madeira, Canaries, Sāo Tomé, Principe, etc.); roots of the **plantation** system
- Portuguese also reached India by going around Africa (Vasco da Gama)

#### Columbus Comes upon a New World
- Stage was set for discoveries:
    - Mariner's Compass was developed, helped sea travel
    - Renaissance improved technology in general
    - Europe had slaves and wealth
    - Spain was becoming rich and united
- Columbus set sail with three small ships and an average crew; bumped into the Bahamas
    - Actually was a "successful *failure*"
    - Called the people there "Indians" because he thought they had reached the Indies (the East)
    - People tried to get around this barrier before they realized it was an entirely new continent

**Work, Exchange, and Technology** As a result for the growing greed of Europe for luxuries and power, new efforts were created in order to further explore the world in order to gain wealth. Through various distinct explorers such as Marco Polo and Vasco da Gama, trade and interest expanded, thus performing a virtuous cycle of increasing exchange and therefore wealth. This was accompanied by an improvement in various technologies, such as the caravel, a better boat for sailing, and other improved navigational techniques. As a result, a steady input of gold and slaves from Africa and exotic goods from Asia&mdash;a great system of economic exchange&mdash; was established, thus increasing the productivity and wealth of Europe in general. Eventually the Americas were discovered, which provided yet another land to use for resources.

#### When Worlds Collide
- The **Columbian exchange** was when Columbus first visited the Americas and different species and people that had been separated for many thousands of years came into contact again&mdash; an unnatural, biological mixing unheard of beforehand
    - The Europeans encountered many new animals, plants, and foods when they arrived, such as rattlesnakes, iguanas, tobacco, corn, beans, tomatoes, and potatoes
    - The introduction of new foods greatly helped feed Europe and the rest of the world
        - 60% of the world's food nowadays originates from the Americas
    - The Europeans also introduced many species as well, such as horses and sugarcane
        - Horses were quickly adopted into Native American lifestyles
        - Sugarcane thrived, and gave a huge boost of sugar in Europe
    - Brought many diseases over: smallpox, yellow fever, malaria 
        - Killed majority (90%!) of Native Americans because they did not have any immunity built up: largest killer brought by Europeans
        - Native American people introduced syphilis to Europeans

**America in the World** For the first time, the Europeans had an interaction with the Native American people in North America. There was a huge cultural exchange between the people of the different cultures, as well as the diseases and the animals. Much of this exchange, called the "Columbian exchange," was helpful, bringing new diversity of food that fed more people and animals that had different abilities to foreign lands. However, it also brought diseases that killed many millions of people, especially the Native Americans. Therefore, this first time that America was introduced to the wider world of the Europeans, many of the Native Americans died&mdash; not a great first encounter.

#### The Conquest of Mexico and Peru
- Europeans noticed the abundant gold resources in Native American cultures
- Spain claimed a right to much of the newly-discovered New World in the **Treaty of Tordesilles**; the Portuguese received considerably less, with some land on the coast of modern-day Brazil
- In the Caribbean islands, the Spanish held forces that waited to attack the Americas. They also began testing out the **encomienda** system
    - In an encomienda, the government "commended" natives to loyal colonists so that they could be converted to Christianity. In practice, however, it was like slavery.
    - Many Europeans, especially those who had not personally seen the New World, thought that the Native Americans were clearly inferior and that the system was okay. However, to some of those who were in the Americas, it was plainly cruel and unfair.
- Spanish conquest:
    - Hernán Cortés picked up a slave who knew the language, Malinche (later Doña Marina). He found 20,000 revolting Native Americans to help him. After being welcomed at first, being thought to be a god, they were soon forced out on **noche triste** because of their excessive want for gold. He later laid siege and took over the city.
    - Francisco Pizarro took over the Incas in Peru, took their precious metals
    - *Gold, Glory, and God* were the major motives for most of the conquistadors, but not always in that order. For some, God came first. For others, such as those who fought the Moors in Spain, sought glory.
- Great increase of wealth in Europe led to growth of **capitalism**: people had more money to spend, banks thrived, it paid for Asian goods
- **Mestizos** were of both Indian and European descent
    - This mix is celebrated by some but hated by others

**Politics and Power** The entire conquest was a struggle for power for the Europeans. Whether they wanted glory for themselves, gold for their country, or God for the rest of Europe under the Church, the conquistadors plundered and put people into slavery in order to gain power. This is especially obvious in the great victories of Cortés or Pizarro, but it exists also in the aftereffects, such as the growth of capitalism back in Europe or the beginning of the encomienda system. For example, in the encomiendas, the ones who had natives commended to them got to keep their power and reap a reward. In turn, every additional piece of wealth gained by a conquistador made its country a little more wealthy, and they had more political power.

#### Exploration and Imperial Rivalry
- Some other famous **conquistadors**:
    - Vasco Balboa was the first European to discover the Pacific Ocean by going through Panama
    - Ferdinand Magellan went around the tip of South America, and one out of his five ships completed their journey back to Europe, the first one to travel all the way around the globe
    - Juan Ponce de León explored Florida
    - Francisco Coronado discovered the Grand Canyon and bison
    - Hernando de Soto discovered the Mississippi River
- The Spanish flourished, building universities and colonizing
- The English (John Cabot) and French (Giovanni de Varrazano and Jacques Cartier) started to explore
- **Battle of Acoma** was when Spanish won the Pueblo people and abused them
- **Popé's Revolution** was when the Pueblo people destroyed Spanish churches when their religion was oppressed
- The **Black Legend** states that the Spanish only left misery behind in the Americas: death, slavery, poverty, disease

**America in the World** The exploration of the various European powers of the time greatly increased America's importance to the world. It was no longer just a Spanish possession, but now it was in the global focus for the first time&mdash; it became attractive and important to other countries and it would never lose this global attention even now. It was also the first time that French and English powers would penetrate the Americas, where their influences still remain (in Canada and the U.S.A.) and still hold great power nowadays. 

With the native Americans, there was also a great cultural interaction that increased the worldliness of the European countries: there was some mixing of cultures with mestizos. Although, much like the "Black Legend," the majority of European influence on the Americas was in the form of unfair treatment, there was a small degree of the knowledge and acceptance &mdash; with a little bit of assimilation &mdash; that the Spanish encountered.

### Chapter 2: The Planting of English America (1500-1733)
- Hundreds of thousands of slaves were in the Bahamas
- English had major outpost in Jamestown; French in Québec; Spanish in Santa Fé

#### England's Imperial Stirrings
- England didn't need to compete with Spain, being its long-time ally
- The **Protestant Reformation** disrupted England for a while (King Henry VIII, Protestants v. Catholics)
    - The Protestant English smothered the Catholic Irish, and thought of them as lowly native people

#### Elizabeth Energizes England
- Ambitious Queen Elizabeth I
- "Sought to promote the twin goals of Protestantism and plunder by seizing Spanish treasure ships and raiding Spanish settlements," even though the two countries were allies
    - Sir Francis Drake was most prominent, even got knighted by the Queen
- Attempted colonization at Newfoundland, at **Roanake Island** (Sir Walter Raleigh); both failed
- The **Spanish Armada** was a huge Spanish fleet intended to invade England; it failed because of smaller, faster ships and a storm
    - Followed by Holland's independence (formerly Spain's Netherlands)
    - Followed by the Caribbean Islands' independence (formerly under Spanish rule)
    - Followed a few centuries later by the collapse of the Spanish empire in the Americas
    - Weakened Spain and boosted English spirits

**Politics and Power** There was a great change in the English politics. Many of the people became poor and oppressed in Protestant England; this gave some people the incentive to move away; as a result, many of them were the first English immigrants to the Americas. Meanwhile, Spain was losing massive amounts of power, having previously overextended itself in efforts to become a great colonial power. This was epitomized when their great, invincible "Spanish Armada" was overtaken by a small and inferior crew of smaller English ships. As a result, many English resorted even to piracy of Spanish treasure ships, because they soon had the military advantage over the weakening Spanish. As a result of both this religious change and the weakening Spanish, the English had much reason to become riled up in search for discovery.

#### England on the Eve of Empire
- England's population was rapidly increasing
- More wealthy people (e.g., landlords) were making it more difficult for the less wealthy (e.g., small farmers); many of these poorer people were the first immigrants to America
    - Example: when there was a depression in the trade of wool, sheep farmers drifted off, were "footloose"
- **Primogeniture** means that only first sons could inherit land; younger siblings had to find a life for themselves
- **Joint-stock company** allowed men to pool their money and work together towards an adventure, or invest on someone else's

#### England Plants the Jamestown Seedling
- The **Virginia Company**, a joint-stock company of England, was created in search of gold and a shortcut through to the East
- The **charter** (a document specifying the rights of a group of people) of the Virginia Company allowed them to have the same rights as anyone in England; this was the same for following English expeditions; it was meant to encourage them, so that they would always feel like Englishmen even when away
- Early conditions in Jamestown were miserable, and there were high rates of death
- Primitive wants for peace between Native Americans and the new Virginians (i.e., Pocahontas and John Smith's colony); this was stopped by the new governor's attack against the Native Americans
- John Smith was very strict: "He who shall not work shall not eat"

**Work, Exchange, and Technology** The joint-stock company was created, a great advancement in business that allowed for the hefty investment in such a risky venture. As a result of an increasing population of the England and the increasing persecution against many poorer people or those without land, this encouraged many wealthy investors to look towards the potentially rewarding explorations into the New World. This allowed for important early joint-stock companies, such as the Virginia Company, to get charters from the government and officially go explore in the Americas. 

#### Cultural Clashes in the Chesapeake
- "Powhatan's Confederacy" was the main tribe in power near Jamestown
- English were raiding the Powhatans out of desperation; Lord De La Warr began attacking them with orders from England
- **First Anglo-Powhatan War** took place, and ended with peace treaty (Pocahontas + John Rolfe)
- **Second Anglo-Powhatan War** took place when Native Americans started retaliating; the English received orders to essentially fight till the death, to reduce the Native Americans to nothing
    - Ended with the Powhatans' defeat and strict terms: they were banished and separated from the English; soon they were extinct
    - Powhatans lost because of disease, disorganization, disposability

#### The Indians' New World
- The Native Americans were not prepared to see anything like the large-scale invasion of the Europeans
- Horses changed the lifestyle of many Native Americans
- Disease wiped out entire cultures; sometimes it killed the elders that held all the knowledge, and all the knowledge of a civilization was wiped out
- Trading with Europeans was very attractive, and there was more violence when fighting over tradeable items
- Some tribes banded together against the great English powers, but this didn't last long

**Culture and Society** The Native Americans experienced a great culture shock when the English began to colonize the Americas. Like with the Spanish, the English almost immediately began to fight with the Indians, and quickly won over with superior technology. They came to peace with the natives a few times with treaties, but these were quickly broken because of distrust or dishonesty, and the retaliation often led to the wiping out of entire nations of indigenous Native Americans. This was accompanied still by the outbreak of European diseases, which added to the destruction. In addition, the introduction of the European market also upset Native Americans because it gave them incentive to be more competitive and fight over tradeable items, which in turn led to more violence and death. Even the few confederacies of multiple anti-English tribes that formed as a result of the oppression did not last long.

#### Virginia: Child of Tobacco
- John Rolfe (Pocahontas' husband) founded the tobacco industry
- Tobacco had a high demand from Europe
- Tobacco needed a lot of labor; when people had enough money to buy slaves, this began the slave industry
- **House of Burgesses** was first assembly in the Americas, allowed under the Virginia Company charter; was one of the first "miniature parliaments" in America
- King James I didn't like tobacco nor the House of Burgesses, so the Virginia Company charter was revoked and Virginia became an English colony

## Maryland: Catholic Haven
- Second "plantation colony," fourth English colony
- Created by Lord Baltimore for wealth and for Catholics that were fleeing from Protestant England
    - Lord Baltimore wanted a new feudal system to be started at Maryland
- Also grew a lot of tobacco, and began to use many slaves
- **Act of Toleration** was heavily voted on by the Catholics, so that the Protestants wouldn't suppress them as they had back in England
    - Not only protected Catholics, but also any religion such as Jews and atheists 

**Politics and Power** The two early colonies of Virginia and Maryland were essentially founded on just a few ideals: in Virginia, the tobacco industry and preliminary Parliamentary-like representative assemblies; in Maryland, also the tobacco industry, but religious tolerance as well. This shows how colonies or states can have defining characteristics that can separate them from other colonies by law; it shows how much power the founders of each state, such as John Rolfe and Lord Baltimore, had so much political power determining the purpose of their state.

#### The West Indies: Way Station to Mainland America
- English took over as main Caribbean power (e.g., taking Jamaica)
- Sugar (cane) was main cash crop
    - It was a "rich man's crop" &mdash; only people with sufficient money to start could profit from sugar, because it required a lot of labor and refinement
- Huge import of slaves into the West Indies at this time (80% population were black)
- **Barbados slave code** denied all the basic rights to the slaves, treating them very much like property
- Slave system was copied and implemented for tobacco farming on the mainland colonies 

#### Colonizing the Carolinas
- Civil War in England when King Charles I abolished Parliament; ended in his death
    - This slowed colonization efforts; it picked up speed again afterwards, in the "Restoration period"
- Carolina colony founded under the rule of the Lords Proprietors (eight nobles)
    - Developed close economic ties with the slave islands of the Barbados
    - Also created a heavy slave trade there
    - Major crop was rice

**Geography and the Environment** The tropical climate lent itself to large harvests and better farming. The islands of the Barbados gave an isolated environment for cheap African slaves. Together, these two geographical phenomenons made the Caribbean islands very attractive for wealthy men with lots of money to buy slaves, because sugar cane quickly became the most profitable crop. This was copied, to some extent, to the mainland colonies, but only to a lesser extent that the climate supported. Therefore, much of the early economy of the Americas was based on this profitable region in the West Indies and its good agricultural conditions.

#### The Emergence of North Carolina
- There were many **squatters**, people without an official right to land, who were cast out by the gentry population of most of Carolina: formed North Carolina
- Many of them grew tobacco by themselves, without the money for slaves
- Were known to be nonreligious and welcoming to pirates
- Were very resistant to authority
- Officially separated from South Carolina and became a colony
- Like Rhode Island, was "most democratic, the most independent-minded, and the least aristocratic of the original thirteen English states"
- Were not friendly with Indian population
    - **Tuscarora War** killed and sold many Native Americans into slavery, and the **Yamasee Indians** were widely scattered; last of the powerful southern tribes

**American and National Identity** As a result of the societal shift towards aristocracy that modeled the European life that they were fleeing from, many "squatters," or poverty-stricken and opportunistic people took off in search of a better land, very similar to the eager explorers who had traveled to the Americas in the first place. As a result, they founded a different colony, founded on more American ideals than many of the richer, European-ish colonies: one which was more religiously tolerant and more defiant to authority. This is the same attitude that carried the Americans to separate from England and defy orders because they felt oppressed.

#### Late-Coming Georgia: The Buffer Colony
- Last of the thirteen colonies, 126 years after Virginia, the first
- Was meant to serve as a **buffer**, a way to stall off the Spaniards and French from South Carolina
    - Received governmental funding from the start because of its military importance
- Created by philanthropists: meant to protect northern colonies, protect indebted people, keep slavery out: the "Charity Colony"
    - Was a melting pot of religions

#### The Plantation Colonies
- Southern mainland colonies: Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia
- Large states
- Mostly profitable cash crops
- All had slaves
- Multitude of farms and plantations made churches and schools hard to establish
- All had religious toleration, but major religion was English Protestant Church
- All somewhat expansionary, looking for more land for farmers

**Culture and Society** Georgia was a state developed upon interesting and virtuous beliefs, such as religious tolerance, debtor tolerance, and the prohibition of slavery. This shows the radical and creative mind of some Americans, the new ideas of the time&mdash; those three beliefs would carry on even to today. However, the older system of an economic system ruled by slaves and a Protestant-dominated colony, similar to the other plantation states, quickly won over, and Georgia lost its uniqueness. These plantation states reflected the ideology of old America: slavery, plantations, and some expansionary interests.
