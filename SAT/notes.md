# Notes to Self about the SAT

## Reading
- Always make sure it is supported by the text. When corned between one that seems more right but is not supported by the text, choose the one that is supported by the text.
- Don't fall behind. Make sure every passage is only 11 minutes or so at maximum.

## Writing
- Know your vocabulary. There are some hard words.

## Math
- Know trigonometric functions, geometric functions. Make it a lot easier than proving things yourself.
- Go quickly. Don't spend too much time, especially on the earlier sections.
- For systems of equations, for weird answers (solve for an expression), try your best to manipulate the expressions to easily get it through addition or subtraction.
